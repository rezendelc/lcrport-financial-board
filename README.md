This project is a personal project with the objective to show a financial board on my portifolio. It includes the following tech stacks: React, Docker and Node.

To run this project on a local machine, clone the repo, create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` and use the command: `docker compose up -d`.
Access `http://localhost:<PORT>` to access the system. The `<PORT>` is based on which port is set on .env file.
